### Introduction

This plugin provides a low cost and high performance international page cache solution based on [Amazon AWS CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

This is the first version of the plugin but the underlying technologies have been tested for over 5 years and some of our clients have achieved long term top 10 positions in Google in over 20 countries using a single server in Amsterdam.

A big advantage of using CloudFront as a page cache for international SEO is that Amazon provides dedicated IP's for geographic regions. This means that a website will physically load from a location near the visitor. For a visitor from Sweden the website may be physically loaded from a server and IP in Stockholm.

An other advantage of Amazon AWS CloudFront as a page cache is that they provide the lowest costs. For an average business website, the total costs may litterally be a few dollars per month. Amazon provides free SSL certificates and there are no hidden costs.

Amazon AWS CloudFront is among the [fastest](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=cloudfront+vs) CDN providers available with the greatest global network. This makes it a perfect option for any website that wants to reach an international audience or that simply wants a fast and secure page cache for a low cost VPS.

This page cache solution makes it possible to use a 5 USD VPS for a heavy WordPress + WooCommerce installation while being capable of handling hundreds of visitors per day (with a fast page speed and good results in Google) for an additional $0.50+ USD per month in AWS costs. For a small business website, the total costs will be less than $1 USD per month while international website speed + Google rankings are of high value.

An example is our demo website www.e-scooter.co which is hosted on a cheap VPS in Switzerland. The website was created in July 2017 and it already has #1 positions in Google for premium search terms in the U.S., India and other regions. The total CloudFront bill for December 2017, including www.pagespeed.pro, www.fastestwebsite.co and some other websites was $0.74 USD.
