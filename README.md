An advantage of Amazon AWS CloudFront as a page cache is that they provide the lowest costs. For an average business website, the total costs will be literally less than 1 dollar per month. Amazon provides free SSL certificates and there are no hidden costs.

An other advantage is that CloudFront supports root domains when using [Amazon AWS Route53 DNS service](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/), making it possible to use CloudFront's CDN for https://yourdomain.com/

Amazon provides dedicated IP's for geographic regions. This means that a website will physically load from a location near the visitor. For a visitor from Sweden the website may be physically loaded from a server and IP in Stockholm.

This makes it a perfect option for any website that wants to reach an international audience or that simply wants a fast and secure page cache for a low cost VPS.
